# SortAlgo-Visualizer

Sorting Algorithm are one of the well known and widely used algorithms.
Many different visualisations can be made over the working of the algos.
I tried to create a small sorting algorithm visualiser in Html, Css and Js. 
I made the visualisations the most common and simple algos such as Bubble,selection,Insertion and merge sort.

Took some help from GFG about the working of await Promise in tandem.
If You wish go check it out https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-delay-a-loop-in-javascript-using-async-await-with-promise/

Also tried my hand out at neumorphism first time. 

Every suggestions will be gleefully welcomed and i would feel priviledged. Thank You!ðŸ™‚
